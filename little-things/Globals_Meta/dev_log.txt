The Little Things will be a side scroller slice of life game where you play as the reincarnation of a wish
To regain your strength, you must make people more satifised and happy
But because you are so weak, you can only do little things

Today I finished the player sprite though I plan on improving it, and I gave it some "animation" and movement
And a small map for testing

10/3/2025
Created the first mission
There is now text, areas to get text
Things to do:
	Organization - when calling nodes with $, create a variable for it and replace all of the $ with that corresponding variable so it is easier to change node names
	Work on the missions

10/4/2025
There is now mission complete dialogue and a punishment dialogue
Rewards aren't in place yet bc character variables aren't fully defined yet. Working on it
Plans:
	levels:
		At level 5, polymorph is available
		At level 10, hope is available (creates a burst of light)
	xp
	strength
	light
	
10/5/2025
Player UI now exists
wish and wishpower has been made
Fixed issue with dialogue when pressing E multiple times
Issues: weird lamp movement sometimes, also not very smooth
	
10/6/2025
There is now a gate
Issues: something wrong with text sometimes not sure
Plans: allow the user to control different objects and make the user unable to escape to go into their spectral form until they get a specific item (they can still switch between different objects)

PLEASE DO THIS LATER ON: CHANGE SPRITES AND BACKGROUND TO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS BETTER AND MATCHES
ALSO PLEASE FIND A WAY TO FAST FORWARD DIALOGUE

Finally figured out how to highlight characterBody2Ds that are within the player
The player can start controlling other characterBody2Ds when they reach level 1
Trying to figure out the outline sucked, I copied Vector code and stuff and added a outline_enabled variable
There is a trophy now as well

REFORMAT CODE TO MAKE IT CLEANER AND MORE EFFICIENT
ALSO ADD A MENU WITH PLAY, SETTINGS, CREDITS, AND CONTROLS
PROBABLY ALSO CREATE A TUTORIAL

10/8/2025
Added background
Debug: you can now level up, rewards only granted after you talk to them

10/9/2025
There is now a new mission: pushing a wall, doeesn't work just yet

10/10/2025
The new mission works

PLAN: work on a title screen, instructions, and credits

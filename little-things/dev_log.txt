The Little Things will be a side scroller slice of life game where you play as the reincarnation of a wish
To regain your strength, you must make people more satifised and happy
But because you are so weak, you can only do little things

Today I finished the player sprite though I plan on improving it, and I gave it some "animation" and movement
And a small map for testing

Created the first mission
There is now text, areas to get text
Things to do:
	Organization - when calling nodes with $, create a variable for it and replace all of the $ with that corresponding variable so it is easier to change node names
	Work on the missions
